      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration webpage for testing a chat component made with Polymer and Socket.IO.
        There are two types of users of this chat, <b>Normal users</b> and the <b>Administrator</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>The Normal user is someone who enters in an e-commerce and needs some kind of support, so she/he clicks the "Customer support" chat button and the chat starts.</li>
          <li>The Administrator is the person who is in the Customer Support's department, helping its customers to solve their problems.</li>
        </ul>
        These two boxes mock a login process. You can either start the chat as a Normal user identified by some username, or start the chat as the Administrator. All the Normal users write directly to the Administrator, but the Administrator can choose which user she/he's talking to.
